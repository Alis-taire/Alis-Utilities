# Alis' Utilities

Alis here, I've decided to publish my useful library of functions and things of that sort for ROBLOX ( maybe you could use it for your lua program..? )! I will try my best to keep this updated, but for now, be happy with what I've published foo.

Contents:
Part 1 - Get Service
Example:
```lua
local allChildren = getChildren(game.Workspace, true)
for __,Child in pairs(allChildren) do
  print("Name: "..Child.Name, "Parent: "..Child.Parent.Name)
end
```
